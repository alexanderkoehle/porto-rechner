# Porto Rechner

### What it does:
Asking for user input and calculating the proper price for shipping.

### Goal of this excercise:
Defining your own container data types in C using struct. Pointer to custom data types.
Repetition: loops in which pointers move across an array (field) of data items.

### How to compile
Compilation tested with Digital Mars Compiler and tdm-gcc.

### Credits:
Big to my classmates that motivated me to program this, altough I do not see much purpose in a porgram like this.
